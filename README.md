# DataViewer

Simple proof of concept tool to view csv and json files, built with Streamlit.

Currently only handles flat json files (un-nested).

## TODO

- Help screen.
- Caching of dataframes.
- Code refactoring to files for each piece of functionality.
- Allow selection of a column for random sampling to select different values off of.
